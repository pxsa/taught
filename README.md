## Common Data Structures in Python

Data structures are something that every Python learner and developer should learn about. Ofcourse they're the basis and fundamental things to know.

### Dictionaries, Maps and Hashtables

Python dictionaries or `dicts` for short are a central data structure. Simply it's just an array with key-value pairs. For example `Phone books`.

```python
phonebook = {
    'hasan': 1234,
    'akram': 3432,
    'siavash': 8765,
}

squares = {x: x*x for x in range(1, 4)}

print(phonebook['akram']) # 3432
print(squares) # {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
```

Python dicts have time complexity of O(1) for lookup, insert, update, ande delete operations in the average case.

### Key Takeaways

- Dictionaries are the central data structure in Python.
- The build-in dict type will bo good enough most of the time.
- Specialized implementations. like read-only or ordered dicts, are available in the Python standard library.
